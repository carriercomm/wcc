# web change checker

First implementation done in bash scripting language.
Actually considering re-implementation in "high-level" language like python or ruby.

The web-change-checker bash script highly relies on **up to date Linux tools** and may stop working on Unix systems.

## Usage

The web-change-checker bash script can be either invoked by hand or automatic via cron on any server environment.
